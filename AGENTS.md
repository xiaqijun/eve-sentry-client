# Repository Guidelines

## Multi-Repository Ownership

This repository is owned by role `10` and contains the desktop warning client:
UI, OCR/capture, local client state, updates, and the server connection. Server,
standalone ESI Gateway, bot, and published wire-contract implementations belong
in their own repositories.

Route new work through role `00`. Any HTTP, SSE, event, cursor, authentication,
or ESI wire change must be reviewed by role `05` against the
[multi-repository development workflow](https://github.com/xiaqijun/eve-sentry-contracts/blob/main/docs/development-workflow.md).
Only one task may write to this repository at a time. Role `90` exclusively owns
production deployment, health verification, and rollback.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
`app/` contains the application code. UI components live in `app/ui/`, OCR and capture logic in `app/engine/`, persistence models in `app/models/`, and the intel web server in `app/server/`. Tests are in `tests/` and follow the runtime modules they cover. Static assets such as `resources/alert.wav` live in `resources/`. Supporting scripts belong in `scripts/`, and design notes or plans are kept in `docs/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Create an environment and install dependencies with `python -m venv .venv` then `.\.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Run the desktop app with `python main.py`.

Run the intel map server with `python -m app.server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765`.

Run the full test suite with `pytest`. For focused work, use `pytest tests/test_detector.py` or similar. Regenerate the alert sound asset with `python scripts/generate_alert.py`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use 4-space indentation, type hints where practical, and short module docstrings like the existing files. Keep modules snake_case, classes PascalCase, functions and variables snake_case, and prefer explicit imports from `app.*`. Follow the current style of small, single-purpose classes and straightforward control flow over heavy abstraction.

## Testing Guidelines
This project uses `pytest` with `tests/test_*.py` naming. Add unit tests alongside the affected module and cover both happy-path and regression cases, especially around OCR parsing, threat cooldowns, and file-backed state. Keep tests deterministic by avoiding real disk writes when a stub or in-memory path will do.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent history uses Conventional Commit prefixes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, and `chore:`. Keep commit subjects imperative and concise, for example `fix: handle missing capture source`. Pull requests should describe the user-visible change, note test coverage, and link any related issue or design note. Include screenshots or short recordings for UI changes in `app/ui/`.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Do not commit local runtime data such as `whitelist.json`, virtual environments, or generated caches. PaddleOCR-related environment setup is handled in `main.py`; preserve that behavior when changing startup code so offline or restricted-network setups keep working.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **eve-sentry-client** (2679 symbols, 6342 relationships, 235 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
